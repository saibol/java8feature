 * This class demonstrate example of default method in Interface
 * -------------------------------------------
 * We can use default and static keyword to create interfaces with method implementation
 * We know that Java doesnâ€™t provide multiple inheritance in Classes because it leads to Diamond Problem.
 * With java8, the solution is that compiler will throw exception in that scenario and 
 * we will have to provide implementation logic if the class implementing the interfaces
